# Milovan Djilas: The Dissident Who Challenged the Communist Elite
 
Milovan Djilas was a Yugoslav communist politician, theorist and author who became one of the most prominent critics of the socialist system he helped to create. He was born in 1911 in Montenegro and joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1932. He rose to prominence during World War II as a leader of the Partisan resistance movement against the Nazi occupation. He was also a close associate of Josip Broz Tito, the founder and president of socialist Yugoslavia.

After the war, Djilas held various high-ranking positions in the Yugoslav government, such as vice-president, minister of defense and chief of propaganda. He was considered one of the most influential and respected members of the communist elite. However, he soon became disillusioned with the authoritarian and bureaucratic nature of the regime, as well as its repression of national and democratic aspirations. He began to express his dissenting views in articles and books, such as *The New Class* (1957), which exposed the privileges and corruption of the communist bureaucracy. He also advocated for a more democratic and decentralized form of socialism, based on workers' self-management and market reforms.
 
Djilas' criticism earned him the wrath of Tito and his allies, who accused him of being a traitor and a revisionist. He was expelled from the party in 1954 and arrested several times for his writings. He spent a total of nine years in prison between 1956 and 1966. He was also banned from publishing his works in Yugoslavia and faced constant surveillance and harassment from the authorities. Despite these hardships, he continued to write and speak out against the regime until his death in 1995. He was widely regarded as one of the most original and courageous dissidents in Eastern Europe, as well as a pioneer of democratic socialism.

Djilas' legacy as a dissident and a democratic socialist is widely recognized and respected in the West, where his books have been translated and studied. He has been praised for his courage, honesty and originality in exposing the flaws and contradictions of the communist system, as well as proposing alternative visions of socialism. He has also been seen as a precursor of the 1989 revolutions that brought down communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
 
However, in his native Yugoslavia and its successor states, Djilas' reputation has been more controversial and polarized. He has been either ignored, vilified or admired by different political and ideological factions. Some have accused him of being a traitor, a revisionist or a nationalist who betrayed the ideals of the Partisan movement and Tito's Yugoslavia. Others have hailed him as a hero, a visionary or a patriot who defended the rights and interests of the Yugoslav peoples and advocated for their democratic self-determination. His writings have been banned, censored or selectively published in different periods and regions.
 
Djilas himself never renounced his Yugoslav identity or his commitment to socialism. He remained critical of both nationalism and capitalism, as well as of authoritarianism and dogmatism in any form. He also maintained his personal friendship with Tito until the latter's death in 1980. He died in Belgrade in 1995, shortly before the outbreak of the Bosnian War that marked the final dissolution of Yugoslavia.
