The book is divided into 18 chapters, each with a summary, review questions, and problems. The first chapter introduces the basic concepts and terminology of telecommunication switching systems and networks. The second chapter discusses the characteristics and analysis of telecommunication traffic, such as arrival patterns, holding times, blocking probabilities, grade of service, and Erlang formulas. The third chapter explains the fundamentals of circuit switching, such as space division switching, time division switching, combination switching, and digital switching systems. The fourth chapter describes the principles of packet switching, such as store-and-forward technique, datagrams, virtual circuits, X.25 protocol, frame relay, and internet protocol (IP). The fifth chapter deals with the signaling methods and protocols used for establishing and releasing connections in telecommunication networks, such as in-band signaling, out-of-band signaling, common channel signaling (CCS), signaling system no. 7 (SS7), and session initiation protocol (SIP).
 
The sixth chapter presents the hierarchical structure and design of telecommunication networks, such as local area networks (LANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), wide area networks (WANs), public switched telephone network (PSTN), public switched data network (PSDN), and public land mobile network (PLMN). The seventh chapter explores the routing techniques and algorithms used for finding optimal paths in telecommunication networks, such as shortest path routing, flooding, distance vector routing, link state routing, hierarchical routing, multicast routing, and quality of service (QoS) routing. The eighth chapter introduces the concept of integrated services digital network (ISDN), which aims to provide a single network for voice, data, and video services. The chapter covers the ISDN architecture, interfaces, channels, protocols, services, and applications. The ninth chapter explains the features and functions of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), which is a high-speed packet switching technology that supports multiple types of traffic with different QoS requirements. The chapter covers the ATM architecture, cells, adaptation layers, signaling, virtual paths and channels, switching, and traffic management.
 
The tenth chapter discusses the evolution and characteristics of optical networks, which use light waves to transmit information over fiber optic cables. The chapter covers the optical components, transmission systems, multiplexing techniques, network topologies, and protection schemes. The eleventh chapter describes the principles and applications of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), which is a technique that allows multiple wavelengths of light to share a single fiber optic cable. The chapter covers the WDM systems, devices, networks, and standards. The twelfth chapter explains the concept and design of optical packet switching (OPS), which is a technique that combines the advantages of optical transmission and packet switching. The chapter covers the OPS architectures, switching nodes, buffering strategies, routing algorithms, and performance issues.
 
The thirteenth chapter introduces the concept and architecture of optical burst switching (OBS), which is a technique that aggregates packets into bursts at the edge nodes of an optical network and switches them without buffering at the core nodes. The chapter covers the OBS components, signaling protocols, burst assembly algorithms, burst scheduling algorithms, and contention resolution schemes. The fourteenth chapter presents the concept and implementation of optical code division multiple access (OCDMA), which is a technique that assigns unique codes to different users or channels in an optical network and allows them to share the same wavelength simultaneously. The chapter covers the OCDMA encoding and decoding schemes, code properties, performance analysis, and applications. The fifteenth chapter discusses the concept and challenges of wireless communication networks, which use radio waves or other electromagnetic waves to transmit information without wires or cables. The chapter covers the wireless transmission media, modulation techniques, multiplexing techniques, multiple access techniques, and cellular concepts.
 
The sixteenth chapter describes the features and standards of wireless local area networks (WLANs
