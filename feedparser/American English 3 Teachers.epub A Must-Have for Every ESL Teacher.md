## Strengths and Weaknesses of the Book
 
One of the strengths of the book is that it follows a communicative approach that aims to get students speaking and using the language in real-life situations. The book provides a variety of topics and texts that are relevant and interesting for students, such as travel, music, sports, and culture. The book also focuses on developing students' pronunciation skills, which are often neglected in other coursebooks. The book uses a systematic and clear way of presenting and practicing the sounds, stress, and intonation patterns of American English.
 
Another strength of the book is that it offers a lot of support and flexibility for teachers. The book has detailed lesson plans that guide teachers through each step of the teaching process, as well as extra activities and ideas that can be adapted to different contexts and learners. The book also has a CD-ROM with tests that can be used to assess students' progress and achievement. The tests can be customized to suit different levels and needs.
 
One of the weaknesses of the book is that it may be too challenging for some students who are not used to the level and pace of the course. The book covers a lot of language and skills in each unit, which may overwhelm some students who need more time and practice to master them. The book also uses authentic materials and tasks that may require a high level of cultural awareness and background knowledge from the students. Some students may find it difficult to understand or relate to some of the texts and topics in the book.
 
Another weakness of the book is that it may be too expensive for some teachers and students who have limited resources and access to technology. The book relies heavily on audio and video materials that are essential for developing listening and speaking skills. However, not all teachers and students may have the equipment or the internet connection to use these materials effectively. The book also has a lot of photocopiable worksheets and handouts that may increase the printing costs for teachers.
