- It may tempt students to cheat by accessing test banks without authorization or sharing them with others.
- It may undermine academic integrity and honesty by giving students an unfair advantage over others who do not have access to test banks.
- It may discourage students from studying the textbook and other course materials in depth, relying instead on memorizing answers from test banks.
- It may reduce students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills by exposing them to questions that are too predictable or easy.
- It may compromise the validity and reliability of assessments by reusing questions that have been leaked or circulated online.
- It may create a false sense of confidence or security among students who think they know everything because they have seen the test bank questions.

Therefore, it is important for students and teachers to use test banks responsibly and ethically. Some of the best practices for using test banks are:

- Use test banks only as a supplement, not a substitute, for studying the textbook and other course materials.
- Use test banks only as a formative assessment tool, not a summative assessment tool, to check your understanding and identify your strengths and weaknesses.
- Use test banks only with permission from your instructor or institution, and do not share them with others or post them online.
- Use test banks only as a guide, not a guarantee, for what will be on the exam, and be prepared for different types of questions and scenarios.
- Use test banks only as a challenge, not a crutch, for improving your knowledge and skills, and do not rely on them too much or too often.

In conclusion, test banks can be a valuable resource for students and teachers who want to succeed in strategic management courses.
