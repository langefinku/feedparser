The magic system of Blade And Sorcery SKIDROW is another aspect of the game that sets it apart from other VR titles. It allows you to use various spells and abilities to enhance your combat and manipulate your environment. You can access the magic menu by holding the top face button (B/Y) on either hand and select one of the four types of magic: Fire, Gravity, Lightning, or Telekinesis[^1^].
 
Fire magic lets you conjure fireballs and throw them at your enemies. You can also control the fireball's trajectory by gesturing with your hand while it is in the air. You can also imbue your weapons or staves with fire magic by holding them against your palm while charging the spell[^1^]. Fire magic is effective against cloth and leather armor, but not against plate armor[^2^].
 
Gravity magic lets you manipulate gravity around you. You can levitate enemies or objects by holding the trigger on your hand and gesture to move them around. You can also push them away with a blast of air by holding the bottom face button (A/X) on your hand. You can also imbue your weapons or staves with gravity magic by holding them against your palm while charging the spell[^1^]. Gravity magic is useful for crowd control and environmental interaction[^2^].
 
Lightning magic lets you unleash bolts of electricity from your fingertips. You can also imbue your weapons or staves with lightning magic by holding them against your palm while charging the spell[^1^]. Lightning magic is effective against plate armor, but not against cloth or leather armor[^2^]. However, lightning magic is not fully implemented yet in the game, and currently only works as a stun-stick when using a staff[^2^].
 
Telekinesis lets you grab objects or weapons from a distance by pointing at them with your hand and holding the grip button. You can also gesture to move them around or throw them at your enemies. You can also grab enemies by their limbs or heads while gravity is active on your hand and use them as weapons or shields[^1^]. Telekinesis is a versatile and fun ability that works well with any weapon or spell[^2^].
