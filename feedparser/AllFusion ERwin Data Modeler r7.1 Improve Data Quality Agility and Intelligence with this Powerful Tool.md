In this article, we will show you how to use AllFusion ERwin Data Modeler R7.1 to create a logical and a physical data model for a relational database schema. We will also explain some of the key features and benefits of this tool.
  
## Creating a Logical Data Model
 
A logical data model represents the business concepts and rules of the data without specifying the physical implementation details. It consists of entities, attributes, relationships and constraints that define the structure and meaning of the data.
 
To create a logical data model with AllFusion ERwin Data Modeler R7.1, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch AllFusion ERwin Data Modeler R7.1 and create a new model.
2. Select the Logical/Physical option from the Model Type drop-down list.
3. Choose the database platform that you want to target from the Target Server drop-down list.
4. Click OK to create an empty model.
5. Add entities to your model by clicking the Entity icon on the toolbar and dragging it to the diagram area.
6. Double-click an entity to open its properties window and enter its name, definition, notes and other details.
7. Add attributes to your entities by clicking the Attribute icon on the toolbar and dragging it to an entity box.
8. Double-click an attribute to open its properties window and enter its name, definition, data type, domain, notes and other details.
9. Add relationships between your entities by clicking the Relationship icon on the toolbar and dragging it from one entity to another.
10. Double-click a relationship to open its properties window and enter its name, definition, cardinality, optionality, notes and other details.
11. Add constraints to your model by clicking the Constraint icon on the toolbar and dragging it to an entity or a relationship.
12. Double-click a constraint to open its properties window and enter its name, definition, type, expression, notes and other details.
13. Save your logical data model by clicking the Save icon on the toolbar or choosing File > Save from the menu bar.

## Creating a Physical Data Model
 
A physical data model represents the actual implementation of the data in a specific database platform. It consists of tables, columns, keys, indexes, triggers and other database objects that define the storage and manipulation of the data.
 
To create a physical data model with AllFusion ERwin Data Modeler R7.1, follow these steps:
