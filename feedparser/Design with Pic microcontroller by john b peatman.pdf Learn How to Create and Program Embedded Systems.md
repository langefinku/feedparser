One of the best resources for PIC microcontroller design is the book *Design with PIC Microcontrollers* by John B. Peatman. This book introduces the PIC microcontroller architecture, instruction set, programming tools, and peripheral functions. It also provides practical examples and code templates that help you learn by doing rather than starting from scratch.
 
In this article, we will summarize some of the key topics and concepts covered in the book, and show you how you can use them to design your own PIC microcontroller projects.

## PIC Microcontroller Framework
 
The first chapter of the book gives an overview of the PIC microcontroller framework, which consists of four main components: the CPU, the program memory, the data memory, and the input/output ports. The CPU executes instructions stored in the program memory, which can be either internal or external. The data memory holds variables and constants used by the program, and can be accessed by direct or indirect addressing modes. The input/output ports allow the microcontroller to communicate with external devices, such as sensors, actuators, displays, etc.
 
The book also explains how to use the MPASM assembler and its directives to write assembly code for PIC microcontrollers. It shows how to define constants, variables, macros, and include files. It also demonstrates how to use the MPLAB IDE and simulator to edit, compile, debug, and test your code.
  
## CPU Architecture and Instruction Set
 
The second chapter of the book dives into the details of the PIC microcontroller CPU architecture and instruction set. It describes how the CPU uses registers, control bits, status bits, and flags to perform various operations. It also explains how the CPU handles interrupts, which are events that require immediate attention from the microcontroller.
 
The book presents the PIC microcontroller instruction set, which consists of 35 instructions that can be classified into four categories: byte-oriented file register operations, bit-oriented file register operations, literal and control operations, and branch operations. It shows how each instruction affects the status register and flags, and provides examples of how to use them in different scenarios.
  
## PIC Microcontroller Peripherals
 
The third chapter of the book introduces some of the most common PIC microcontroller peripherals, such as timers, counters, serial communication modules, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), comparators, pulse-width modulators (PWMs), etc. It explains how these peripherals work and how they can be configured and controlled by using registers and bits. It also provides examples of how to use these peripherals in various applications.
 
For instance, the book shows how to use timers and counters to measure time intervals or generate periodic signals. It also shows how to use serial communication modules to transmit and receive data between PIC microcontrollers or other devices. It also shows how to use ADCs to convert analog signals into digital values that can be processed by the microcontroller.
  
## PIC Microcontroller Design Examples
 
The fourth chapter of the book presents some PIC microcontroller design examples that illustrate how to apply the concepts and techniques learned in the previous chapters. These examples include:
 
- A blinking LED program that uses a timer interrupt to toggle an output port bit.
- A keyswitch scanner program that uses a state machine implementation to debounce and scan a matrix of keyswitches.
- A serial echo program that uses a serial communication module to receive a character from a terminal program and echo it back.
- An analog voltmeter program that uses an ADC module to measure an input voltage and display it on a seven-segment LED display.
- A PWM motor controller program that uses a PWM module to control the speed of a DC motor based on a potentiometer input.

The book provides detailed explanations of each example program, along with code listings, block diagrams, circuit schematics, and simulation results.
  
## Conclusion
 
*Design with PIC Microcontrollers* by John B. Peatman is a comprehensive and practical guide for learning how to
