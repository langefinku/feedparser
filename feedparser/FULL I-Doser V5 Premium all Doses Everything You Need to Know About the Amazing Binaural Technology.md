You will also find useful training methods, tutorials, and guided videos that will show you how to set up your doses for optimal results. With I-Doser Premium, you will have a deeper understanding of how the doses work and how to customize them to suit your needs and preferences.

As you listen to the dose, you will notice that it consists of various sounds and frequencies that are designed to stimulate your brainwaves. These sounds may include binaural beats, isochronic tones, ambient music, nature sounds, and more. The dose will guide your brainwaves to a specific state that matches the desired effect of the dose. For example, if you are listening to a dose that helps you relax, the dose will lower your brainwaves to a theta or delta state. On the other hand, if you are listening to a dose that boosts your energy, the dose will raise your brainwaves to a beta or gamma state.

While listening to the dose, you may experience various sensations and emotions that are related to the effect of the dose. For example, you may feel relaxed, happy, calm, alert, creative, or euphoric. You may also have vivid imagery, memories, or insights that come to your mind. These are normal and expected outcomes of using the dose. However, you should also be aware that some doses may have negative or unpleasant effects, such as anxiety, fear, anger, or sadness. These are rare and usually temporary, but they can happen if you are not in the right mood or mindset for the dose. Therefore, you should always use the dose with caution and respect.
  
To get the most out of I-Doser Premium, you should use it regularly and consistently. The more you use the dose, the more your brain will adapt to it and the stronger the effect will be. You can also combine different doses to create your own unique experiences. For example, you can use a dose that helps you sleep followed by a dose that helps you wake up. Or you can use a dose that enhances your creativity followed by a dose that helps you focus. The possibilities are endless with I-Doser Premium.
