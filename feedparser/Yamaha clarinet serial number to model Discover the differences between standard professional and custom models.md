## Standard-Professional Models (YCL-2XX-6XX)
 
These models have the model number stamped on the upper joint, near the top. The serial number is stamped on the reverse side at the bottom of the lower joint. For example, if you have a YCL-450 clarinet, you will see "YCL-450" on the upper joint and a six-digit number on the lower joint. The first two digits of the serial number indicate the year of manufacture, while the last four digits indicate the production number. For example, a serial number starting with "12" means that the clarinet was made in 2012.
 
## Custom Models (YCL-800-)
 
These models have a mark on the barrel and upper joint that indicates the model name. For example, if you have a YCL-CSGIII clarinet, you will see "CSGIII" on both parts. The serial number is stamped on the reverse side at the bottom of both joints. The first two digits of the serial number indicate the year of manufacture, while the last four digits indicate the production number. For example, a serial number starting with "18" means that the clarinet was made in 2018.
 
## Bass Clarinets or Alto Clarinets
 
These models have the model number engraved at the top of the top joint, near the mouthpiece. The serial number is engraved on the reverse side at the bottom of both joints. For example, if you have a YCL-221 bass clarinet, you will see "YCL-221" on the top joint and a six-digit number on both joints. The first two digits of the serial number indicate the year of manufacture, while the last four digits indicate the production number. For example, a serial number starting with "14" means that the clarinet was made in 2014.

## How to Care for Your Yamaha Clarinet
 
Once you have found the model and serial number of your Yamaha clarinet, you may want to know how to care for it properly. Yamaha clarinets are designed to last for a long time, but they still need regular maintenance and cleaning to keep them in good condition. Here are some basic tips on how to care for your Yamaha clarinet:
 
- After each playing session, wipe the inside and outside of the clarinet with a soft cloth or a swab. This will remove any moisture and dirt that may damage the wood or metal parts.
- Apply a small amount of cork grease to the tenons and sockets of the joints. This will prevent them from drying out and cracking, and make them easier to assemble and disassemble.
- Check the pads and springs of the keys for any wear or damage. If you notice any problems, take your clarinet to a professional repair shop for adjustment or replacement.
- Store your clarinet in a sturdy case with a humidifier. This will protect it from dust, humidity, and temperature changes. Avoid leaving your clarinet in direct sunlight or near heat sources.

## How to Play Your Yamaha Clarinet
 
Now that you have learned how to find the model and serial number of your Yamaha clarinet and how to care for it, you may want to know how to play it well. Yamaha clarinets are known for their high quality and performance, but they still require proper technique and practice to sound their best. Here are some basic tips on how to play your Yamaha clarinet:

- Choose a suitable reed for your clarinet. The reed is the thin piece of wood that vibrates when you blow into the mouthpiece. The reed affects the tone, pitch, and response of your clarinet, so you should choose one that matches your skill level and preference. Yamaha offers different types of reeds for different models of clarinets.
- Adjust the position of the reed on the mouthpiece. The reed should be aligned with the tip of the mouthpiece, with a thin gap between them. You can use a ligature or a rubber band to secure the reed on the mouthpiece.
- Hold the clarinet correctly. The clarinet should be held at a 45-degree angle from your body, with your right hand on the lower joint and your left hand on the upper joint. Your thumbs should support the weight of the clarinet on the thumb rests, while your fingers should cover the tone holes and press the keys gently.
- Breathe properly. The clarinet requires a steady stream of air to produce a clear and consistent sound. You should breathe from your diaphragm, not from your chest, and use your tongue to start and stop each note.
